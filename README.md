# Electric-Vehicle-Next-Charge-Location-Prediction
Many EV studies investigated routing or charge station management, while research on predicting energy demand at a specific location was lacking. To address this, our study focused on predicting EV's next charge location. We developed a localised onboard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that achieved accuracies up to 95%.
